Animation-edit is a small tool to help create sprite animations.

To use: 
Place a sequence of .png images in a directory.
Start animation-edit.
Choose File->Open...
Open the folder with .png's and write a filename, must end with .xml (eg. myanimation.xml)
The .png's are added automatically.
The animation should be shown.
You can edit the duration of each frame.
You can choose the play back speed of the animation.
You can give tag names to certain frames, and choose to jump from one one frame to a tag. (Image->Edit frame tag/next tag)
If you edit any image in an external image editor, animation-edit will automatically reload the images. So you can draw a bit and then immediately see the changes.

Status:
The application is functional but under early stages of development.
